# WeatherPro

deployed app: https://afc2134.github.io/WeatherPro/

This is an app designed to give you the weather of the city you wish to search for.
It also stores previous searches and can display multiple searches at once. 

this app uses the free 3rd party API OpenWeather One. Html for the framework, Javascript to dynamically render results, and css for some basic styling.
I researched which color palette is most used for weather apps so I chose to make the colors slightly stylisticly differnet then the mock up.
